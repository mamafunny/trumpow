TrumPOW [$TRMP]
</h1>


TrumPOW introduces an innovative world of meme-inspired cryptocurrency, blending humor with blockchain technology. It is created to bring joy, entertainment, and interaction to the crypto community. Operating on a decentralized, community-focused ecosystem, TrumPOW seeks to merge the excitement of memes with the advancements of blockchain.

Unlike all iterations before it, Trumpow is a layer 1 coin. This means there are no liquidity pools to drain, no blacklisting wallets, and no confusing smart contracts. Trumpow is a simple blockchain.

The TrumPOW software allows anyone to operate a node in the Trumpow blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Dogecoin Core, Bitcoin Core, and other cryptocurrencies.

For information about the default fees used on the Trumpow network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

Changes:

* Addresses start with `T` instead of `D`
* BIPS features will start block 1000
* AuxPow / Merged mining starts at block 60,000 (Chain ID: 168)
* GUI themed for Trumpow
* Coin Name    : TrumPOW
* Coin ticker  : $TRMP
* Algorithm    : Scrypt
* Block Time   : 60 seconds
* Explorer 1   : https://explorer.trumpow.meme
* github       : https://github.com/trumpowppc/trumpow
* Wallet       : https://github.com/trumpowppc/trumpow/releases


## Usage üíª

To start your journey with TrumPOW, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by TrumPOW is self-documenting and can be browsed with `trumpow-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `trumpow-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Ports

TrumPOW by default uses port `33884` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `15612` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   33884 |   44884 |   18544 |
| RPC      |   33883 |   44883 |   18432 |
